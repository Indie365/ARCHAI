Introduction
============

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a method of automatically discovering and optimizing neural network architectures. This approach has the potential to greatly speed up the process of designing effective neural networks for a wide range of tasks and hardware platforms.

The traditional method of designing neural network architectures involves a significant amount of human effort and trial-and-error. This can be time-consuming and expensive, and may not always result in the best possible architecture for a given task. NAS aims to overcome these limitations by using a principled algorithmic approach to search for the optimal architecture.

One of the key open problems in NAS is how to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. In other words, how to strike a balance between trying out new architectures and refining existing ones. This problem is particularly challenging in the context of deep learning, where the search space is vast and the number of possible architectures is enormous.

Another open problem in NAS is how to effectively evaluate the performance of different architectures. In order to determine which architecture is best for a given task, it is necessary to have some way of measuring its performance. This can be difficult, especially when dealing with complex tasks and large datasets.

A third open problem in NAS is how to incorporate domain knowledge into the search process. In many cases, human experts may have valuable insights into the structure of optimal architectures for a particular task. Incorporating this knowledge into the search process can help guide the search towards more promising architectures.

Overall, NAS presents a promising avenue for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of neural network design. By automating the search process, NAS has the potential to discover new architectures that may have taken much longer to find through human trial and error. Additionally, NAS can help tailor architectures to specific tasks and hardware platforms, enabling more efficient and effective neural network models.
