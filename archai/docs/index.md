# Archai Documentation

**Archai** is a platform for Neural Network Search (NAS) that allows you to generate efficient deep networks for your applications. It offers the following advantages:

* ðŸ”¬ Easy mix-and-match between different algorithms;
* ðŸ“ˆ Self-documented hyper-parameters and fair comparison;
* âš¡ Extensible and modular to allow rapid experimentation;
* ðŸ“‚ Powerful configuration system and easy-to-use tools.

## Initial Steps

To install the latest release:

```terminal
pip install archai
```

Please refer to the [installation guide](getting-started/install.md) for additional help.

```{note}
Archai requires Python 3.6+ and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) 1.2+.
```

### Toy Mode Experiment

The fastest way to try out the basic functionalities of Archai is to run a *toy mode* experiment using every available algorithm:

```terminal
python scripts/main.py
```

By switching to *toy mode*, algorithms will use tiny batches and a single epoch.
