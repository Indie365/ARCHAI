## Installation

There are various methods to install Archai, but it is recommended to use it within a virtual environment, such as `conda` or `pyenv`. This ensures that the software runs in a consistent and isolated environment, and allows for easy management of installed packages and dependencies.

PyPI provides a convenient way to install Python packages, as it allows users to easily search for and download packages, as well as automatically handle dependencies and other installation requirements. This is especially useful for larger Python projects that require multiple packages to be installed and managed.

**Archai requires Python 3.7+ and PyTorch 1.7.0+.**

```bash
pip install archai
```

Please refer to the [installation guide](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/getting_started/installation.html) for more information.

## Quickstart

To run a specific NAS algorithm, specify it by the `--algos` switch:

```terminal
python scripts/main.py --algos darts --full
```

Please refer to [available algorithms](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/advanced_guide/nas/available_algorithms.html) for more information on available switches and algorithms.

## Examples

Archai is a cutting-edge NAS platform that uses advanced Machine Learning algorithms to perform a wide range of tasks. In order to illustrate the capabilities of Archai, we will present a series of examples that showcase its ability:

* [Notebooks](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/basic_guide/notebooks.html);
* [Scripts](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/basic_guide/examples_scripts.html);
* [30-Minute Tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/basic_guide/tutorial.html);
